    <h1>My Favorite City</h1>
    <p>My favorite city is Madrid, I love Madrid because I love the soccer club "Real Madrid" and the players in it even
        if they are not Spanish citizens, I love the backgrouund nature I see in the post of those soccer players and I
        admire their areas even though I have only seen it through pictures, I also love the espanol language they speak
        or Spanish as its known in English. I really wish to travel to Spain as a country and visit my favorite city.
