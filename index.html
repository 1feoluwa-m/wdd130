        <p> Hello there!, I'm Ifeoluwa Akinola from Abuja, Nigeria. I love learning new things that will be of benefit
            to me and also to others, I enjoy watching soccer sometimes, I'm passionate about Medicine as a course and I
            enjoy helping people in the little way I can. I am a fan of wrestling and also that of Action movies. I am
            currently learning web design and development from BYU Idaho and I am excited to see where this leads me and
            who I can help with the knowledge I am gaining from this.</p>
